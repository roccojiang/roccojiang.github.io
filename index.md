I'm currently a student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) studying [Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), having just finished my first year of studies.

You can find my blog posts on computing-related topics here, as well as other miscellaneous rambles and thoughts.
