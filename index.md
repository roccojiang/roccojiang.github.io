title: About me
---

I'm a third-year student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) studying [Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/). I have an interest in functional programming and programming language theory in general. Currently, I am highly enjoying learning about type theory in the excellent [Type Systems for Programming Languages](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~svb/TSfPL/) course.

You can find my blog posts on computing-related topics [here](/posts), as well as other miscellaneous rambles and thoughts.

## Projects
Below is a brief selection of my more interesting projects:

### Maze generation visualisation
*([github](https://github.com/ethanrange/c-maze-generation))*
*([blog post]({% post_url 2021-09-30-arm11-extension %}))*

Implementations of common maze generation and pathfinding algorithms, visualised with the Raylib game engine in C. Written in a group of 4, over the period of about a week.


### Simple programming language interpreter
*([github](https://github.com/roccojiang/traversal-lang))*

An interpreter written in Python for a simple educational programming language I designed, called Traversal. Completed for my [Extended Project Qualification](https://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/projects/project-qualifications/EPQ-7993) in Sixth Form.
